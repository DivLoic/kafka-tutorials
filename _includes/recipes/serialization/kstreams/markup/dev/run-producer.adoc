When the console producer starts, it will log some text and hang, waiting for your input. 
You can copy and paste all of the test data at once to see the results. 

Start the console producer with this command in a terminal window of its own:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/serialization/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/console-producer-movies.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the producer starts up, copy and paste these lines into the terminal:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/serialization/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/movies.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

Looking back up in the consumer terminal, these are the results you should see there if you paste in all the movies as directed above:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/serialization/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/avro-movies.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

That is a topic for further study later on, but for now, you deserve some congratulations!  
Well done.
