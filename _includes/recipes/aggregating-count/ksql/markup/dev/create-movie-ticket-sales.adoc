First, you'll need to create a Kafka topic and stream to represent the ticket sales. 
The statement below creates both in one shot. 
An important characteristic of the data is the timestamp because this can be used for time-based windowing. KSQL can use either the Kafka message timestamp, or a field from the message value as the timestamp. In this example we'll use the latterâ€”the _event time_ as stored in the `timestamp` field of the message value.
