Lets’s describe the keys pieces of this program.

Reminder: we use an externalised config and this app loads its config from the _consumer_ bloc of the `application.conf`

A `Consumer#conusme` function covers most of the record consumption.

- `Consumer#conusme` takes a
`https://kafka.apache.org/25/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html[KafkaConsumer]`
and gives back a collection of `Book`.

- `Consumer#consume` call the `KafkaConsumer#poll` and gets a `ConsumerRecords` filed with as much books as the
`fetch.max.bytes` Consumer Config allows.

- `Consumer#consume` extracts the value from each records. The consumed books will filled `bookMap`, our book collection
of type `mutable.Map[String, Book]`.

- We also have two functions `getCount` and `getBooks` just defining two HTTP routes.

Now what do we need to call our new `Consumer#consume` function?

- `typedDeserializer[T]` is introduced to lighten the tutorial and quickly get a `Deserializer[Book]`
(See dev part n°3).

- We carefully configure, the deserializer with a map containing the schema-registry url.

- Then we instantiate the `KafkaConsumer` by passing a Java Properties from the _consumer.client-config_ block of
`application.conf`.

- We subscribe to the book's topics by calling `KafkaConsumer#suscribe` with a topic name collection.

That's it! we are ready to poll records in a infinite while loop to keep our Map of book updated.

Note that we've added a shut down hook to close the consumer by calling `KafkaConsumer#close`.

Note that the `KafkaConsumer` is created and used in a new thread.
It's is really important to use it in a _*single*_ Thread.
In our case it's not the main thread because we also have a HTTP server.
