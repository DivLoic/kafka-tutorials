The instances of case class in our code will be serialize in an https://avro.apache.org/[Avro] format.
To do so, we will need the appropriate serializers/deserializers.
We add the following function to easily create a `Serializer[T]` where `T` in the type of the key or the value
we'd like to serialise.

If the Specific method (where code is generated from schemas) for creating record is more common,
in scala you might want to use the reflection method (where schemas is generated from code)
to preserve your case class flexibility. That's why we include https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s[avro4s],
a scala library generation of Apache Avro objects. It will create records or instances in two steps:

- Serialization:    Raw bytes <- Generic Records <- Case Class Instances
- Deserialization:  Raw bytes -> Generic Records -> Case Class Instances
