`sbt-jib` is an sbt alternative to the gradle/maven plugin for https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib].
It will be useful to package our application.


Note: Most tutorials will include a schema code generation plugin.
Since code generation is not a common practice in scala we will deal with the schema by using automatic derivation instead.
If you still want to use code generation with sbt plugins,
the classic https://github.com/sbt/sbt-avro[Java class generation plugin] can be used in our scala application.
But plugins like https://github.com/julianpeeters/sbt-avrohugger[avro-hugger] will be a better fit for our scala application since it brings scala case class generation.
